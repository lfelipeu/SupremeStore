		<p style="font-size: 14px; color: black">Supreme is an American clothing and skate brand founded in New York City in April 1994. The brand produces clothing, accessories and also skateboards. Its shoes, clothing, and accessories are widely sold on the secondary or resale market, where they can fetch prices well above their original retail price. Its simple and distinctive logo, also known as boxlogo in English, with Supreme written in white on a red background is based on the artistic propaganda of Barbara Kruger.</p>
